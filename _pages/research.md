Growing populations around the world have been un-sustainably utilizing natural resources,
disrupting the global biodiversity and climate. This have endangered the livelihood of future generations. To
understand and mitigate these land changes, imaging technologies have made it easier to observe and
understand the changes and complex drivers so that we can design sustainable solutions and make smart
decisions. In this regard, microwave remote sensing data such as SAR have been a game changer
for providing images in near real time in almost all weather day and night. However, the large
volume of image data that is being acquired from all available SAR satellites in orbit and the number of
skilled professionals that are available to analyze and derive much needed insights is greatly
imbalanced. 

Therefore, machine learning based approaches that processes global scale data and derive complex insights from
these images with a minimum human interaction is the focus of my reasearch. My ambition is to
develop machine learning methods that uses radar remote sensing images to help derive accurate,
robust and usable information relating to land change and their related drivers at scale.
