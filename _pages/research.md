Growing populations around the world have un-sustainably utilizing natural resources, have
disrupted the global biodiversity and climate endangering the livelihood of future generations. To
understand and mitigate land change, imaging technologies have made it easier to observe and
understand the complex drivers so that we can design sustainable solutions and make smart
decisions. In this regard, microwave remote sensing data such as SAR have been a game changer
for providing high quality images in all weather day and night. At this time, however, the large
volume of image data that is being acquired from all available satellites in orbit and the amount of
skilled professionals that are available to analyze and derive much needed insights is severely
imbalanced. Therefore the available information was not fully utilized. Therefore,
building
machine learning models that process, analyze global scale data and derive complex insights from
these diverse set of images with a minimum human interaction is important. My ambition is to
develop machine learning methods that uses radar remote sensing images to help derive accurate,
robust and usable information relating to land change and their related drivers.
