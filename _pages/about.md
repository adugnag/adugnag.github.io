I am a research scientist and big data engineer at Ctrees, a non-profit startup based in California. Our organization's mission is to comprehensively track carbon in every tree worldwide and provide science-based geospatial data to support natural climate solutions across various scales. Additionally, I hold a visiting researcher position at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability (IoES) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

In my previous role, I worked as a researcher at the Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing at Wageningen University from 2019 to 2023. During this time, my focus was on the development of radar and deep learning methods for near-real-time forest change monitoring. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in Microwave Remote Sensing at the University of Twente in Enschede, The Netherlands, in 2017. As part of my academic journey, I had the privilege of being a visiting scientist at the Lyle School of Civil Engineering at Purdue University in the United States from 2016 to 2017. Furthermore, I conducted research at the University of Twente, where I explored deep learning methodologies for crop classification using polarimetric SAR data between 2018 and 2019.

My research interests revolve around leveraging microwave remote sensing and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of environmental monitoring. Specifically, I focus on image and signal processing and information extraction from SAR, PolSAR, and InSAR data using advanced machine learning such as deep learning. Throughout my career, I have contributed to cutting-edge deep learning models for SAR and PolSAR image despeckling, PolSAR image semantic segmentation, as well as SAR time-series forecast and segmentation. Moreover, I have extensive experience in building large-scale remote sensing data processing pipelines in Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud to enable near-real-time change monitoring at a global scale.

As an active member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (IEEE GRSS), I actively engage in professional communities. Additionally, I serve as a referee for several esteemed journals, including IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.
