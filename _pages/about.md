I am a researcher in 'Radar and Deep Learning Methods for near-real time forest change monitoring' at the Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing, Wageningen University (2019-Present). I obtained my PhD (2017) in Microwave Remote Sensing from the University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands. Before Joining Wageningen University I was a visiting scientist at Lyle School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, United States (2016-2017). I was also a researcher at the University of Twente investigating deep learning methodologies for crop classification using polarimetric SAR data (2018-2019).

My research interest is on using microwave remote sensing and machine learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in environmental monitoring with a particular focus on SAR, PolSAR and InSAR signal processing and information extraction using deep neural networks. I have worked on state-of-the-art deep learning models for SAR and PolSAR image despeckling, PolSAR image semantic segmentation as well as SAR time-series forecast and segmentation. I have also worked on building a big remote sensing data load, extract and transform pipelines in Google Earth Engine and Google CLoud for continental scale near-real time change monitoring. I am a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. I am also a Referee for multiple journals, including IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Ssensing Letters and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Eearth Observations and Remote Sensing.
