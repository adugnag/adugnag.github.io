As my research interest is in processing SAR, PolSAR and InSAR signal processing I have developed several scripts to these effect. Some selected developments are:

# Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter analysis ready data preparation in Google Earth Engine

I am the main developer and maintainer of the [gee_s1_ard]([/images/software/](https://github.com/adugnag/gee_s1_ard) of Javascript and Python scripts that are used to process Sentinel-1 SAR ground range detected images to the analysis ready data level. The scripts perform additional border noise correction, mono-temporal and multi-temporal speckle filters and radiometric terrain correction.
